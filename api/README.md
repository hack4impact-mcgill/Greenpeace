# Greenpeace Backend

## Overview
The frontend of the application will serve the maps UI by accessing the Google Maps API and rendering the result using React, with additional components from Material UI. Our complete (frontend) tech stack is:
- Express.js
- Prisma


## Setup

To create the `.env` file, copy the `.env.example` file, make sure you are in the `backend` folder and run the following:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, start the Docker Compose services, use the command:

```
docker-compose up
```
